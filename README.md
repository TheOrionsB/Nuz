## Nuz

Nuz is a simple project that I develop to make myself comfortable with VueJS version 3.
It's yet another URL shortener that may be deployed one day.

#### It will be:
- Free
- Encrypted
- Include password protected links
- Include link expiracy (optionnal)

Its backend is in a separate repo "nuzStnrAPI" that also uses a technology that's a first for me, typescript.

#### Build

- Clone repo
- ``yarn install``
- ``yarn serve``

#### Run tests
- ``yarn coverage``
- ``yarn test:unit``
- ``yarn test:coverage``
